            <h1>Julie Mathis</h1>
                <p>Hi, my name is <strong>Julie Mathis</strong>. My husband, Gordon, and I have been married for 37 years. We have six children and nine beautiful grandchildren. I recently received my <em>AAS in Applied Business Management</em> and am starting on my bachelor degree in <em>Professional Studies</em>. Since I returned to school after raising our children, my husband has begged me to take a computer programming class. He's a Software Engineer and thinks everyone should pursue a CS degree. So to please him, I took one HTML class last year as an elective. To my surprise, I loved it, so now I am pursuing a <em>Frontend Certificate</em> and who knows, maybe go on for a CS degree after all.
