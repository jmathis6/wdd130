                <p>Hi, my name is <strong>Julie Mathis</strong>. I recently received my <em>AAS in Applied Business Management</em> and am starting on my <em>Bachelors in Professional Studies</em>. I was going to get a bachelors in Business Management, but decided I didn't like the marketing classes. My husband has begged me since I returned to school to take a computer programming class. He's a Software Engineer and thinks everyone should pursue a CS degree. So to please him, I took one HTML class last year as an elective. To my surprise, I loved it! Then I wished I would have listened to him and taken the class early on. If I had, I would have changed my career direction. However, I was too close to getting my degree, so I stuck it out. Now that I am starting on my bachelors, I have decided to pursue Professional Studies so I can get a Web Design and Development Certificate. This sounds much more fun than marketing classes! Who knows, once I get my certificate, I may want to go on and get my CS degree. That would make my husband happy.
