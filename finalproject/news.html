                    <p>We have been good friends with the Orton's since Gordon and Jerry served together in the bishopric many years ago. Jerry loved to work with wood and made us many items that we cherish.</p>
                    <p>The last thing Jerry told Gordon in the hospital before he passed away was, "I love you; you were the son I never had." He and Gordon worked together on many projects and Gordon feels like he has lost his best friend.</p>
