                <p>We met Jerry and his wife, Nikki, when Gordon was serving with him in the bishopric nearly 20 years ago. We became good friends and they adopted our family, asking us to call them "Grandpa Jerry and Grandma Nikki."</p>
                <p>The last thing Jerry told Gordon in the hospital before he passed away was, "You were the son I never had. I love you."</p>
