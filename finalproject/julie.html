                <p><b>November 8, 2019.</b> Gordon's employer, Smarty Streets, paid for Gordon, Julie, Mckell, and Karen to go to Hawaii for a week. Our first two days was spent at Disney's resort, Aulani, which is on the island of Oahu. We spent the time enjoying the resort and the beach. Of coures, we had to take the girls to snorkel at Hanauma Bay (our favorite place to snorkel). I remember the first time Gordon and I went to Hawaii and went snorkeling at Hanauma Bay. We both loved it and wished we could bring our kids there. It was a treat to be able to take the girls there.</p> 
                <p><b>Novmeber 10, 2019.</b>Our last night on Aulani, we attended a luau with the other employees of Smarty Streets. Since it was a Disney resort, we had guest appearances from Moana and Mickey and Mouse.</p>
                <p><b>November 11, 2019.</b>After Aulani, we boarded a cruise ship for a 7-day cruise around the Hawaiian islands. This has been a dream of Julie's for as long as she can remember. She was thrilled to be able to go with Gordon and two of her girls. Everyone wished the whole family could have come. Maybe someday.</p>
                <p><b>November 12, 2019.</b>Cruising the islands was the best! The girls went zip-lining on Kawaii and we all took a helicopter ride around the island. So cool!</p>
                <p><b>Novmber 13, 2019.</b> On Maui, we visited the aquarium and Gordon and the girls went bodysurfing on a beach that had a sign that said, "No swimmming." The waves were extra big and rough, so much so that Gordon lost his snorkeling mask, but they had a blast bodysurfing those big waves.</p>
                <p><b>November 14, 2019.</b> On the big island of Hawaii, we attempted to d.rive the windy, dangerous road of ... We didn't get too far before we decided to stop risking our lives and go back to the ship!</p>
                <p><b>November 15, 2019.</b> On Oahu, we visited the LDS Temple grounds and the Dole Plantation to enjoy an authentic Dole Whip with fresh pineapple (there's nothing better)!</p>
                <p><b>Nomber 16, 2019.</b> On the ship we enjoyed meals together with our friends, sitting around the pool at night, and ship-board entertainment. Overall, we had a great time.</p>
